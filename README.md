## write a summary of your tribe leader's journey of transformation

As I grew up, I wanted to change the world for the better with technology.  I believed in Big Science's ability to lead a path forward for humanity to a better world.  To that end, I got a double degree in math and physics from UC Berkeley, a PhD in applied physics from Yale, and then had a career of another 15 years of working in the federal government, big companies, public and private universities, startups(I have started two companies and been involved with starting a third), and non profits. 

After years of work in research(I'm still in it) I became increasingly of the opinion that something was very deeply wrong with how science and technology work in our society.  The more sides of pure and applied physics I saw, the more I felt that this was not the problem of one lab or one field or even of just science but of the whole structure of our civilization.  After a particularly painful business failure in around 2014, I decided to work the minimum possible amount of consulting work and dedicate my time to trying to chart a better way forward for applied science and technology.  What I ended up with was a book, the Trash Magic Manifesto and Action Coloring Book, which describes a totally new way of thinking about technology.  Having built a blueprint for a new way of thinking about technology, I proceeded to build components of the systems that would need to exist if this is going to scale up to all of humanity.  I have built a web framework and computer language for building a network of open documents which can describe a free and open technology which provides for all human needs.  

My need to build things on a solitary path led to me running out of money and taking a job working in Big Science again.  Now, humanity is at a crossroads: things are changing very fast, and I can no longer sit on the sidelines writing papers about my ideas and writing code shared only with a select few.  Now is the time I will dedicate every ounce of my being to bringing the ideas of Trash Magic to the world, to create a better world for all of us to live in.


Your problem is that you learned STEAM to build a better world for people but ended up just serving the needs of the machines(both literally and figuratively in the form of companies and institutions). By joining together we can build a science and technology that is truly free to help humanity directly.

## Write down the future based mission of your tribe  (people want to be a part of omething bigger than themselves)

What is best in life?  To care for one another and to have adventures.  

We believe that technology should *only* focus on achieving these two goals for the minimum possible effort, and that it should require no input of newly mined materials.  Magic is defined here as "the replication of desire", and trash is the waste stream of the existing industrial order which we shall overthrow.  In Trash Magic we will, collectively, build a collection of self-replicating documents which can be used to replicate the physical technology required to satisfy all human needs, both physical and spiritual.  We imagine a world of plenty, where our technology is all self-replicating, and forms an ecosystem of materials, energy and information which live in harmony with the living Earth.

## Write down your away from rally Cry (start with "it's time..."

It's time for us to build the technology we need to live free lives dedicated to caring for one other, and not for the cold logic of machines.  We seek to replicate the desire to replicate the technology here to all of humanity.  Join us to copy these things and share them with others and with each other until we are all able to live without the existing industrial system and without money.

Success is defined by replication.
